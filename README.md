# odin-recipes
I've created a simple recipe page that links to three different recipes.
I included unordered and ordered lists, p tags, and different sized header tags.
I also added images for each recipe using relative filepaths to retrieve them from their parent directory. 
I used the target attribute for each recipe page. The recipes will each be opened in a new tab, so the viewer will be able to look at each recipe side by side. 
This was a fun little project. 👍
