# odin-recipes
I've created a simple recipe page that links to three different recipes.<br>
I included unordered and ordered lists, p tags, and different sized header tags.<br>
I also added images for each recipe using relative filepaths to retrieve them from their parent directory.<br>
I used the target attribute for each recipe page.<br>
The recipes will each be opened in a new tab, so the viewer will be able to look at each recipe side by side.<br>
This was a fun little project. 👍<br>
